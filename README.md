# 🚫🤖 no-ai Firefox Extension

Tired of seeing AI-related posts on Reddit? Want a cleaner, more human feed? **no-ai** is here to help! This extension automatically hides posts about AI, so you can scroll in peace. ✨

---

## ✨ How It Works

🔍 Scans every Reddit post for a list of AI-related keywords (like `AI`, `ChatGPT`, `GPT-4`, and more).

🙈 If a post contains any of these keywords, it disappears from your feed! The filter is case-insensitive for most keywords, but only hides posts with the exact uppercase `AI` (so French words like "j'ai" are safe!).

## 🛠️ Custom Keywords

Want to block even more topics? Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to add or remove your own keywords. Enter a keyword and click **Add**—your custom list is saved locally and used alongside the default filter.

---

## 🖼️ Icons Included

For a polished look, the extension includes these icons:

- `icon-32.png`
- `icon-48.png`
- `icon-64.png`
- `icon-96.png`
- `icon-128.png`
