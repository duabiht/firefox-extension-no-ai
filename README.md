# no-ai Firefox Extension

This extension automatically hides Reddit posts that mention AI topics. It works by scanning each post for a list of AI-related keywords (like "AI", "ChatGPT", "GPT-4", etc.).

If a post contains any of these keywords, it is hidden from your Reddit feed. The filter is case-insensitive for most keywords, but only hides posts with the exact uppercase "AI" (so French words like "j'ai" are not affected).

## Custom Keywords
You can add or remove your own keywords by clicking the extension icon in your browser toolbar. Enter a keyword and click "Add" to include it in the filter. These custom keywords are saved locally and used in addition to the default list.

Just install the extension and browse Reddit as usualâ€”AI-related posts (and any posts matching your custom keywords) will be removed automatically.
