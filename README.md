# 🛑 Filterit (Firefox Extension)

Filter any Reddit posts using your own keywords. Filterit lets you customize what you don't want to see and browse Reddit with less noise.

---

## ✨ How It Works


🔍 Scans every Reddit post for a list of keywords (ships with a default list you can fully edit).

🙈 If a post contains any of these keywords, it disappears from your feed. Most matches are case-insensitive, but you can keep case-sensitive ones like `AI` if you want.
