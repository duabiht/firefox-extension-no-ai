# no-ai Firefox Extension

This extension automatically hides Reddit posts that mention AI topics. It works by scanning each post for a list of AI-related keywords (like "AI", "ChatGPT", "GPT-4", etc.).

If a post contains any of these keywords, it is hidden from your Reddit feed. The filter is case-insensitive for most keywords, but only hides posts with the exact uppercase "AI" (so French words like "j'ai" are not affected).

Just install the extension and browse Reddit as usualâ€”AI-related posts will be removed automatically.
