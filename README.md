# no-ai Firefox Extension

This extension automatically hides Reddit posts that mention AI topics. It works by scanning each post for a list of AI-related keywords (like "AI", "ChatGPT", "GPT-4", etc.).


If a post contains any of these keywords, it is hidden from your Reddit feed. The filter is case-insensitive for most keywords, but only hides posts with the exact uppercase "AI" (so French words like "j'ai" are not affected).

## Custom Keywords
You can add or remove your own keywords by clicking the extension icon in your browser toolbar. Enter a keyword and click "Add" to include it in the filter. These custom keywords are saved locally and used in addition to the default list.

## Icons
The extension includes the following icon files for best compatibility:
- icon-32.png
- icon-48.png
- icon-64.png
- icon-96.png
- icon-128.png

## Support

Just install the extension and browse Reddit as usualâ€”AI-related posts (and any posts matching your custom keywords) will be removed automatically.
