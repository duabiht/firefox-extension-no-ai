# 🚫🤖 no-ai Firefox Extension

Tired of seeing AI-related posts on Reddit? Want a cleaner, more human feed? **no-ai** is here to help! This extension automatically hides posts about AI, so you can scroll in peace. ✨

---

## ✨ How It Works

🔍 Scans every Reddit post for a list of AI-related keywords (like `AI`, `ChatGPT`, `GPT-4`, and more).

🙈 If a post contains any of these keywords, it disappears from your feed! The filter is case-insensitive for most keywords, but only hides posts with the exact uppercase `AI` (so French words like "j'ai" are safe!).

## 🛠️ Custom Keywords

Want to block even more topics? Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to add or remove your own keywords. Enter a keyword and click **Add**—your custom list is saved locally and used alongside the default filter.

---

## 🛠️ DevTools Panel (Advanced Debugging)

The extension now includes a custom **No-AI Filter** tab in your browser's DevTools (F12), just like Adblock Plus!

- **Live stats**: See how many posts were found, hidden, and how many times the filter ran.
- **Live logs**: All extension activity and filtering decisions are shown in real time, with color-coded log levels.
- **Controls**: Run the filter manually, clear logs, or export logs as a text file.

**How to use:**
1. Reload the extension in Firefox (about:debugging or via Add-ons page).
2. Open Reddit and press F12 to open DevTools.
3. Click the new **No-AI Filter** tab to monitor and debug the extension in real time!
